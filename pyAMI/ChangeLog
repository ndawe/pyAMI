Jerome.Fulachier@lpsc.in2p3.fr

The pyAMI package has been completely remodelled.
It is now much more convenient for command line use.
The architecture of command wrappers has been changed.
Each command now has its own wrapper.
The reply from the AMI web service is now a DOM object.


v0.9.9.2 [10 Oct 2005]
pyAMI.py
   listProjects() has been temporarily reinstated for backward-compatibility.
   listProcess() has been introduced to replace listProcesses(). The latter
   will still be available for now.
   The 'project' argument for listProcess() (and listProcesses()) is renamed 
   'projectName'.
   The '=' character in the sql argument in searchQuery() will be escaped.

v0.9.9.1 [04 Oct 2005]
pyAMI.py
   listProjects() method replaced by listProject() to match AMI API change.

v0.9.9 [15 Sep 2005]
pyAMI.py
   Bug in pyAMI.py does not allow for SSL connections. Also, moved AMI 
   Web Service address to new location at 
   "https://atlastagcollector.in2p3.fr:8443/AMI/services/AMIWebService"

v0.9.8 [11 Aug 2005]
pyAMIConfig.py
   Removed file based configuration i.e. removed the need for .pyAMIcfg.

pyAMI.py
   Allowed for large data payload.

v0.9.7 [21 Feb 2005]
pyAMIConfig.py
   Corrected typo error in import statement that caused configParser 
   exceptions to be invalid.

v0.9.6 [27 Jan 2005]
pyAMIConfig.py
   More problems. Any AMI command (e.g. listDataset) is given ALL parameters 
   that had been stored in the config file! This behaviour is obviously not
   correct. This has now been corrected and the behavour is now as follows:
   The config file (default set to $HOME/.pyAMIcfg although any valid Python
   config file may be used) will contain the 'AMI' and 'AMIMISC' sections. 
   The 'AMI' section should NOT be modified manually as this will cause the 
   'AMI' section to be cleared and recreated. The 'AMIMISC' section will 
   contain the 'separator' option and any other option i.e. other 
   applications may add options.

pyAMI.py
   Replaced name changes to reflect changes to config file.

v0.9.5 [10 Jan 2005]
pyAMIConfig.py
   Bug fixes to the way configuration options are stored. A bug (corrected) 
   converted option names to lower case before storing to config file. 
   Another bug (corrected: similar to that found in v0.9.3) made options 
   that user added to be ignored even though they exist in the config file.

v0.9.4 [22 Nov 2004]
__init__.py
   Added missing entries in __all__ .

pyAMI.py
   Added the ability for an exception to be raised when an error in 
   the SOAP response is detected.
   Added extra parameter to AMI_WS_Client() to define alternative 
   configuration file.
   Updated tutorial.

AMIWebServiceService_services.py
   Added debug trace for SOAP requests and response. Commented out though.


v0.9.3 [19 Oct 2004]
pyAMIConfig.py
   Corrected bug in the includeCfg() method that discards any extra 
   parameters provided by user.


v0.9.2 [27 Aug 2004]
pyAMI.py
   Changes to AMI_WS_Client class. A configuration file is introduced to allow 
   user to set the AMIPass, AMIUser, project and processingStep parameters 
   without having to specify them repeatedly. They can still be specified at the
   command line and the default will be overwritten.
   
   No existing interfaces have changed. There is an addition of a helper 
   function resetCfg() to assist with configuration file maintenance. 

pyAMIConfig.py
   This modules provides the machinery to create and update the configuration 
   file ('pyAMI.cfg' by default).


v0.9.1 [13 Aug 2004]
pyAMI.py
   Added simple tutorial in pyAMI.py.

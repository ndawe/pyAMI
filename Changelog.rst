Version 4.1.1 (XX/YY/ZZZZ)
--------------------------

* Upgrade to buildout 2.0.0
* Fix a few import issues in pyAMI.extern.ZSI

Version 4.1.0 (4/2/2013)
------------------------

* A patched version of ZSI is now included in pyAMI.extern that removes
  dependency on PyXML.
* argparse is now included in pyAMI.extern.
* A minimal pyAMI installation (no lxml) now does not depend on any external
  non-standard library packages.
* Added the -F and --from-file to the "ami list datasets" command where the
  pattern is interpreted as a file name which will be read for patterns (one per
  line, ignoring blank lines or lines beginning with #).
* Added the option to perform literal matches with "ami list datasets"
  using the new optional flags -L or --literal-match. In this case the pattern
  is interpreted as a literal string and the results must match exactly.
  A literal match query is much faster than a patterned match and can greatly
  speed up commands where you want to query information for known elements.
  This option pairs nicely with the new --from-file feature mentioned above for
  files listing many complete dataset names that should be interpreted literally
  and not as patterns.
* AMI errors are now printed correctly.

Version 4.0.4 (6/11/2012)
-------------------------

* Fix globbing issue. Only surround pattern with % if the pattern didn't have %
  on both ends originally. (it needed more fixing!)
